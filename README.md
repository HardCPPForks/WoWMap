WoWMap
=======

This project aims to read and extract data from World of Warcrafts game data files, mainly focusing on terrain. In its current state the project is able to read from the CASC archives, and parse ADTs/WMOs/M2s and chunks thereof. Eventually the project will also include a navmesh generation.

Feel free to contribute.
